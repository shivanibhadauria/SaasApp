## 📖 How to Use

### Adding New Pages:

- Create a new file under the `pages/` directory. For example:
  ```bash
  touch pages/about.js
  ```
  Add your React component to the file. It will automatically be accessible at `/about`.

### Adding Tailwind Styles:

- Use Tailwind classes directly in your components:
  ```jsx
  <div className="p-4 bg-gray-100 text-center">Hello, Tailwind CSS!</div>
  ```

### Using shadcn Components:

- Import components from shadcn into your project:

  ```jsx
  import { Button } from "@shadcn/ui";

  const App = () => <Button>Click Me</Button>;
  ```
