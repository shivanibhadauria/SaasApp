# Next.js Project 🚀

This is my first **Next.js** project, built with modern tools and a focus on clean design and performance. The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, integrates **shadcn** for pre-designed, accessible components, and includes dynamic routing. Recently, I added **Clerk Authentication** for login and sign-up functionality.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **shadcn Components**: Pre-built, accessible, and customizable components.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Navigation and route management with built-in Next.js capabilities.
- **Clerk Authentication**: Easy-to-integrate authentication system with login and sign-up features.

## 📖 How to Use

### Adding New Pages:

- Create a new file under the `pages/` directory. For example:
  ```bash
  touch pages/about.js
  ```
  Add your React component to the file. It will automatically be accessible at `/about`.

### Adding Tailwind Styles:

- Use Tailwind classes directly in your components:
  ```jsx
  <div className="p-4 bg-gray-100 text-center">Hello, Tailwind CSS!</div>
  ```

### Using shadcn Components:

- Import components from shadcn into your project:

  ```jsx
  import { Button } from "@shadcn/ui";

  const App = () => <Button>Click Me</Button>;
  ```

### Adding Clerk Authentication:

- To protect a page or route, use Clerk's higher-order component `withClerk` or hooks like `useClerk` to manage authentication states:

  ```jsx
  import { useUser } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

  const ProfilePage = () => {
    const { user, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useUser();

    if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    if (!isSignedIn) return <div>Please sign in.</div>;

    return <div>Welcome, {user.firstName}!</div>;
  };
  ```
